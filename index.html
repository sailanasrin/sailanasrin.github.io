                 <h3>dua lipa new rules lyrics</h3>
                 <p>Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy <br>
                        (Out of my mind, out of my mind) <br>
                        Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me <br>
                        (Too many times, too many times) <br>
                        My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else <br>
                        But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
                    </p>
