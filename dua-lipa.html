    <h3>New Rules Lyrics</h3>
    <p>
        Talkin' in my sleep at night <br>
        Makin' myself crazy <br>
        (Out of my mind, out of my mind) <br>
        Wrote it down and read it out <br>
        Hopin' it would save me <br>
        (Too many times, too many times) <br>
        My love, he makes me feel like nobody else <br>
        Nobody else <br>
        But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself <br>
        I tell myself
    </p>
    <p>
        One, don't pick up the phone <br>
        You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone <br>
        Two, don't let him in <br>
        You'll have to kick him out again <br>
        Three, don't be his friend <br>
        You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning <br>
        And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
    </p>
