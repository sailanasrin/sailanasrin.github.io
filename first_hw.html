                    <p>   Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy <br>
                              (Out of my mind, out of my mind) <br>
                           Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' 
                                    it would save me <br>
                              (Too many times, too many times) <br>
                           My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else <br>
                               But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell 
                                       myself, I tell myself
                       </p>
